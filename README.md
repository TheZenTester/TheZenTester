- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheZenTester
- 👀 I’m interested in anything network-, web-, or cloud-pentesting.  I recently just passed my OSCP. I'm hoping to build a repo of my skills and useful tools I come across.  My focus for the next few months is going to be organizing all my notes - after emerging from the fog that was OSCP prep, I've realized a lot of my notes/tools are disorganized, and there are ways to improve my methodology.  However, I'm only at this point thanks to an awesome comunity of cybersecurity professionals.
- 🌱 I’m currently growing my pentest skills by focusing on the OS WEB-200, HTB/VulnHub/ProvingGrounds, and potentially taking the GIAC GSE exam (Part I for now)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting more exposure to the world of Penetration Testing
